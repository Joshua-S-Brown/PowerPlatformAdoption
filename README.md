**Welcome to the Power Platform Adoption Program!**

As we embark on this transformative journey to integrate the Power Platform into our organization, you, as a pivotal product manager, will be guiding us through the process. You're not just adopting a new tool; you're catalyzing a shift in how we approach work, enhancing efficiency, fostering innovation, and empowering every team member to do more.

Our roadmap is your comprehensive guide to this adoption process, structured into strategic phases each with its specific tasks and acceptance criteria. It's an exciting journey, one where you'll be discovering and aligning with stakeholders, establishing dynamic teams, implementing robust governance policies, fostering a champion network, and leading the training, launch, automation, and continuous improvement of our Power Platform use.
